In the column you want to combine cells into (example column D) use the following formula. 


=CONCATENATE(A1,B1,C1)

Function also accepts ranges:

=CONCATENATE(A1:C1)

The 2 above would give the same result. 


Options for seperation between the combined cells. 

=CONCATENATE(A1,"-",B1,"-",C1)

The above is an example of combining Columns for Year, Month, Day into a single cell. 

Example expected formula strings: 
=CONCATENATE(columnAndRow,"seperator",columnAndRow,"seperator",columnAndRow)
